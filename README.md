# R Demos


## Installation

This project uses [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) to handle dependency managemnt. To get this projct set up on your own system, open the project in RStudio (and open the `.Rproj` file), install `renv` (`install.packages("renv")`), and run `renv::init()`. 

> If you haven't installed any R packages yet, this might take a little while.
